# light-switch

It's the three-way switch of your dreams.  Like any other three-way switch, you can operate the light from two locations.  But this one also keeps the state of the switches themselves synchronized!  Toggle away without fear of obsessive compulsions.

Implemented in React. Utilizes stateful components.
